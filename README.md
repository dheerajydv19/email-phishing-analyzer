# Phishing Email Analyzer
A tool that is designed to analyze emails to determine whether they are likely to be phishing attempts or not.

## What is it?

A phishing email analyzer is a tool or system that is designed to analyze emails to determine whether they are likely to be phishing attempts. Phishing is a type of cybercrime in which attackers send fake emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, in an attempt to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. These emails can be difficult to detect, because they often mimic the appearance and language of legitimate emails.


Phishing email analyzers use various techniques to try to identify phishing emails. Some analyzers use machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of emails and look for patterns that are characteristic of phishing emails. Others use rules-based systems that look for specific indicators of phishing, such as suspicious phrases in the subject line, illegitimate sender addresses, or malicious links in the email body. Some analyzers also use reputation databases that track the histories of known phishing domains, in order to flag emails from these domains as potentially suspicious.

Overall, the goal of a phishing email analyzer is to help protect users from falling victim to phishing attacks by identifying and flagging potentially malicious emails before the user has a chance to interact with them.

## Problem Statement 
The number of phishing attacks on enterprises and the public is increasing daily. It's difficult for the general public to analyze suspicious emails due to the complexity of various tools available for analysis and using various strategies.
